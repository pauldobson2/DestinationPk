									<p>As a tour company, we follow Pakistan government guidelines while assisting travelers. To receive an invitation letter (LOI) from us, it's necessary to utilize our tour services. We suggest booking multiple Lahore short tours, multi-day Punjab or Gilgit area tours, or custom trips for LOI issuance. Feel free to contact us to discuss your travel plans, and we'll recommend suitable options. Our commitment lies in transparency and honesty throughout our services.</p>

									<h3>What's Required and How to Obtain it:</h3>
										<p>Destination Pakistan assists travelers from various global locations, both within and outside their countries, in securing visas for Pakistan.</p>
										<p>Our services include providing travelers with a letter of invitation, our company's tourism license, and ongoing advice and assistance throughout the visa application.</p>
										<p>All visa applications are now processed digitally through the NADRA online system. However, visa assessments usually take place at the nearest embassy, creating challenges in following up with specific processing staff in case of issues.</p>
										<p>While basic document requirements remain consistent across countries, the application processes may differ significantly. Checking the Embassy or Pakistan High Commission's website is vital to understand specific prerequisites, alongside information available on the Nadra Evisa system.</p>
										<p>Unfortunately, the visa process can be laborious and stressful for some. Drawing from our experiences, we compile information to ease this process and regularly update to provide the latest insights. Below, find a compilation of frequently asked questions to address common concerns across various situations.</p>

									<h3>The Pakistan E-Visa and Visa on Arrival:</h3>
										<p>In March 2019, the Ministry of Interior introduced the Pakistan E-Visa and Visa On Arrival online system, which has become a reliable and stable process. While the initial requirements appear flexible, accepting hotel bookings as proof of travel, the process can be more complex. Some travelers have experienced swift approval within 24/48 hours via the E-Visa system, while others faced requests for additional information or were asked to provide an invitation letter before approval. The process remains somewhat unpredictable.</p>
										<p>Destination Pakistan has received numerous inquiries from travelers who attempted the online system with only hotel bookings and encountered challenges. Many were advised to submit an invitation letter from a tour company. Interestingly, this trend is observed across various countries and is not specific to any particular embassy. The process remains variable and unpredictable, reflecting the nature of travel to Pakistan</p>

                        <p>In most cases, approximately 70% of the time, yes. While the Pakistan Evisa system allows applying without an invitation letter, many travelers who attempted this approach were later asked by the Pakistani government to provide one. Not having an invitation might slow down the process. Some embassies consistently require an invitation from a Pakistan Registered Tour Company.</p>
                        <p>When unsure, having a Letter of Invitation (LOI) is advisable; it often expedites the visa process and adds assurance.</p>

                        <p>Typically, for a Pakistan Tourism Visa, the invitation letter should ideally come from a registered tour company. While sometimes a friend's invitation might suffice, it's often not accepted. If you're applying for a family or business visit, it's more appropriate for the family member or business partner to extend the invitation. However, it's crucial to note that despite the temptation to have any "friend" write the letter, there's a significant security responsibility attached to this. The inviting person must be prepared to answer questions regarding your travel, know details about your visit, activities, and have a clear explanation of their relationship with you.</p>

                        <p>Occasionally, travelers have attempted to obtain invitations from hotels, but it's not a guaranteed process. Hotels, unlike registered tour operators, lack the licensing to issue invitations. While some hotels may oblige, others might refuse or have limitations due to language barriers, particularly with understanding the visa process. If you opt for a hotel invitation, NADRA might request additional documentation to support your application.</p>
